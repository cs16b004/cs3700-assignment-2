Respected Sir, we tried to implement ram based dbms  using yacc and lexer but
could not get the bug we worked quite hard but due to failure of parser
pivoted to top-down parsing (hard coded)

use g++ main.cpp
./a.out
only 

select * from car/student and
insert into car/student values "data1" "data2"

will be accepted

give colon after a space
It can be extended to work for create table using a vector of generic tuple struct
and naming that tuple type by adding another data field this_name;

The tokenize function is used to tokenize query

Given The time constraint plus the fact that yacc approach didn't worked we could have
developed a dbms according to specification.

parser and lexer files attached they are not working properly.
Kindly Consider
